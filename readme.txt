ERD takes information from film screenings then provides a serial number for the ticket, which can then be associated with a customer and a salesperson. 
The ERD also has a simple "consessions" table which is also associated with the customer. 
ERD also assigns serials to both the seller and the customer for tracking purposes. 

Please note that simple screenings & empployees databases can be found in the "databases" folder
